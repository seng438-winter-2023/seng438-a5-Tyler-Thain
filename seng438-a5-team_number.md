This entire lab was a struggle. There was not one aspect of the assignment where a difficulty was encountered. That said we every challenge we faced, was overcame. #personalGrowth

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself

This lab is a mess. Baffled by the amount of tools, data, and instructions that were either unclear, didn't work or just completely wrong. I would say that the assignment needs to be updated so that I can be unstood, but in reality the entire thing needs to be throw into the bin. I personally was confused from the start and could't ask any questions as the TAs also did not know how to help. 0/10
